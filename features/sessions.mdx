Octo persists conversations in SQLite and tracks sessions for easy resume.

## Resuming Sessions

```bash
octo --resume              # resume the last session
octo --thread <thread-id>  # resume a specific thread
```

## Session Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/sessions` | List recent sessions (current marked with `*`) |
| `/sessions <id>` | Switch to a specific session |
| `/clear` | Start a fresh conversation (new thread) |

## How It Works

- Sessions are saved to `.octo/sessions.json` with metadata: thread ID, timestamps, message preview, model used
- Conversation state is checkpointed in `.octo/octo.db` (SQLite) via LangGraph's built-in checkpointer
- Sessions auto-save on: startup, `/clear`, `/sessions` switch, and each user message
- The supervisor and all workers share the same thread — full context is preserved across agents
