Skills are reusable prompt modules packaged as `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter. They can declare dependencies, requirements, and permissions.

## Managing Skills

  <Tab title="From Chat">
    ```
    /skills              # list installed skills
    /skills search pdf   # search marketplace
    /skills install pdf  # install + auto-install deps + reload
    /skills remove pdf   # uninstall + reload
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="From CLI">
    ```bash
    octo skills search pdf              # search marketplace
    octo skills info pdf                # detailed info + deps
    octo skills install pdf             # install with dependency resolution
    octo skills install pdf --no-deps   # skip dependency installation
    octo skills remove pdf              # uninstall
    octo skills update --all            # update all installed
    octo skills list                    # list installed
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Dependency Resolution

Dependencies declared in `SKILL.md` frontmatter are installed automatically:

| Type | How It's Installed |
|---|---|
| **Python** | `pip install` into the active venv |
| **npm** | `npm install --prefix .octo/` (local node_modules) |
| **MCP** | Added to `.mcp.json` (activate with `/mcp reload`) |
| **System** | Displayed for manual installation (e.g. `brew install`) |

At startup, Octo checks installed skills for missing Python deps and logs warnings. At runtime, missing deps are detected and the agent is instructed to install them before proceeding.

## Invoking Skills

Use the skill name as a slash command:

```
/<skill-name>
```

## Creating Skills

Use `/create-skill` for an AI-assisted wizard, or write `SKILL.md` files manually. See [Creating Skills](/guides/creating-skills) for the full guide.

## Skills.sh Integration

Discover and import skills from the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) ecosystem:

```
/skills find <query>              # search skills.sh registry
/skills import owner/repo         # install all skills from a repo
/skills import owner/repo name    # install a specific skill
```

Imported skills land in `.octo/skills/` and are tagged with `source="skills.sh"` in `/skills list`. The skills.sh format (SKILL.md + YAML frontmatter) is fully compatible with Octo's format.

## Skill Directories

Octo scans three directories for skills (first match wins):

1. `.octo/skills/` — primary, managed by Octo
2. `.agents/skills/` — project-level skills
3. `.claude/skills/` — Claude Code compatible skills
