description: Heartbeat timer and cron scheduler — Octo reaches out first

Octo doesn't just respond to prompts — it can reach out proactively when something needs attention.

## Heartbeat

A periodic timer (default every 30 minutes) that checks if there's anything worth telling you.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Phase 1: Cheap Check">
    A low-tier LLM reads `.octo/persona/HEARTBEAT.md` (your standing instructions) and recent context. It decides: **is action needed?**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase 2: Full Graph (if needed)">
    Only when Phase 1 says yes, the full supervisor graph is invoked. This keeps costs low — most heartbeat ticks are Phase 1 only.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delivery">
    Results are delivered via CLI output and/or Telegram message. The `HEARTBEAT_OK` sentinel suppresses delivery when there's nothing to say (no notification spam).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configuration

```env
HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30m                  # 30m, 1h, 60s, etc.
HEARTBEAT_ACTIVE_HOURS_START=08:00      # local time
HEARTBEAT_ACTIVE_HOURS_END=22:00        # local time
```

### Standing Instructions

Edit `.octo/persona/HEARTBEAT.md` to tell Octo what to check for. Example:

```markdown
# Heartbeat Instructions

- Check if any scheduled tasks are overdue
- Monitor GitHub issues for new critical bugs
- Remind me about standup at 9:45 AM
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/heartbeat` | Show heartbeat status |
| `/heartbeat test` | Force a heartbeat tick now |

## Cron Scheduler

A persistent job scheduler for recurring and one-shot tasks.

### Job Types

| Type | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `at` | `in 2h`, `15:00` | One-shot, fires once |
| `every` | `30m`, `1d` | Recurring interval |
| `cron` | `0 9 * * MON-FRI` | 5-field cron expression |

### Commands

```
/cron                    # list all jobs
/cron add <spec> <task>  # schedule a new job
/cron remove <id>        # delete a job
/cron pause <id>         # pause without deleting
/cron resume <id>        # resume a paused job
```

### Self-Scheduling

Agents can schedule their own follow-ups using the `schedule_task` tool. For example, a research agent might say: "I'll check back in 2 hours to see if the API data has updated."

Jobs are stored in `.octo/cron.json` and survive restarts.

## Error Recovery

Both heartbeat and cron jobs use `invoke_with_retry` — the same retry logic as interactive chat. Transient failures are handled automatically:

| Error Type | Recovery |
|---|---|
| **Connection dropped** | Reset Bedrock client, clean orphaned tool calls, retry with backoff |
| **Timeout** | Retry with backoff; auto-compact context on 2nd timeout |
| **Rate limit** | Wait with longer backoff (5s, 15s, 45s) |
| **Context overflow** | Auto-compact conversation, then retry |
| **Orphaned tool calls** | Inject synthetic tool responses, then retry |

Up to 3 retries with exponential backoff (3s → 9s → 27s). If all retries fail, the error is logged and the job continues on its next schedule.

<Tip>
Combine heartbeat with cron for powerful workflows: use heartbeat for general monitoring and cron for specific scheduled tasks.
