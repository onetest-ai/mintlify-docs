description: Three layers of protection against context overflow

Long conversations can exhaust the model's context window. Octo has three automatic layers of protection plus manual controls.

## Automatic Protection

### Layer 1: Tool Result Truncation

`TruncatingToolNode` at the supervisor level caps tool results at 40K characters. This prevents a single large file read or API response from filling the context window.

Configurable via:

```env
TOOL_RESULT_LIMIT=40000
```

### Layer 2: Worker Summarization

`SummarizationMiddleware` on worker agents triggers when:
- Context reaches 70% capacity, **or**
- Message count exceeds 100

When triggered, older messages are summarized by a low-tier LLM and replaced with a compact summary, keeping the most recent 20 messages intact.

### Layer 3: Supervisor Auto-Trim

The `pre_model_hook` on the supervisor monitors context usage before every LLM call. When context exceeds 70%, it trims old messages while preserving 40% of the most recent history.

## Manual Controls

### /compact

Force-summarize older messages to free up context:

```
/compact
```

Uses a low-tier LLM to summarize old messages, then replaces them with the summary. Useful when you notice responses degrading.

### /context

Visual context window usage bar:

```
/context
```

Shows a color-coded progress bar:

| Color | Quality | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Green | PEAK | < 50% |
| Yellow | GOOD | 50-70% |
| Orange | DEGRADING | 70-85% |
| Red | POOR | > 85% |

## Tuning

All thresholds are configurable in `.env`:

```env
SUMMARIZATION_TRIGGER_FRACTION=0.7     # 0.0–1.0
SUMMARIZATION_TRIGGER_TOKENS=100000
SUMMARIZATION_KEEP_TOKENS=20000
SUPERVISOR_MSG_CHAR_LIMIT=30000        # per-message safety net
```

<Tip>
If you notice responses becoming less coherent or losing track of context, run `/context` to check usage, then `/compact` to free space.
