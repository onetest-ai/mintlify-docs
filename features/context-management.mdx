Long conversations can exhaust the model's context window. Octo has four automatic layers of protection plus manual controls.

## Automatic Protection

### Layer 1: Tool Result Truncation

`TruncatingToolNode` at the supervisor level caps tool results at 20K characters before they enter the checkpoint. This prevents a single large file read or API response from filling the context window.

Configurable via:

```env
TOOL_RESULT_LIMIT=20000
```

### Layer 2: Tool Result Aging

After each invocation, `auto_trim_tool_results` scans the checkpoint for old tool results (beyond the last 10 messages). Results exceeding 4K characters are:

1. **Saved to disk** at `.octo/workspace/<date>/tool-result-<name>-<ts>.md`
2. **Replaced in the checkpoint** with a truncated version containing a file path reference

This keeps the checkpoint lean while preserving full data on disk. The agent can retrieve the original result via the Read tool if needed.

### Layer 3: Worker Summarization

`SummarizationMiddleware` on worker agents triggers when:
- Context reaches 70% capacity, **or**
- Message count exceeds 100

When triggered, older messages are summarized by a low-tier LLM and replaced with a compact summary, keeping the most recent 20 messages intact.

### Layer 4: Supervisor Auto-Trim

The `pre_model_hook` on the supervisor monitors context usage before every LLM call. When context exceeds 70%, it trims old messages while preserving 40% of the most recent history.

## Manual Controls

### /compact

Force-summarize older messages to free up context:

```
/compact
```

Uses a low-tier LLM to summarize old messages, then replaces them with the summary. Useful when you notice responses degrading.

### /context

Visual context window usage bar:

```
/context
```

Shows a color-coded progress bar:

| Color | Quality | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Green | PEAK | < 50% |
| Yellow | GOOD | 50-70% |
| Orange | DEGRADING | 70-85% |
| Red | POOR | > 85% |

## Tuning

All thresholds are configurable in `.env`:

```env
SUMMARIZATION_TRIGGER_FRACTION=0.7     # 0.0–1.0
SUMMARIZATION_TRIGGER_TOKENS=100000
SUMMARIZATION_KEEP_TOKENS=20000
SUPERVISOR_MSG_CHAR_LIMIT=30000        # per-message safety net
```

<Tip>
If you notice responses becoming less coherent or losing track of context, run `/context` to check usage, then `/compact` to free space. Old tool results are automatically saved to `.octo/workspace/` before removal — the agent can retrieve them if needed.
