Octo maintains persistent memory across sessions. Agents can write observations, and the system tracks project state automatically.

## Memory Types

### Daily Logs

The `write_memory` tool appends timestamped entries to `.octo/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. These capture day-to-day observations, decisions, and findings.

```
.octo/memory/
├── 2025-01-15.md
├── 2025-01-16.md
└── 2025-01-17.md
```

### Long-Term Memory

A curated `MEMORY.md` file updated via `update_long_term_memory`. This contains stable patterns, architectural decisions, and recurring solutions — information that stays relevant over time.

### Project State

`STATE.md` captures the current position of your project:
- Active plan and progress
- Key decisions made
- Open questions
- Next steps

The STATE.md is loaded into the system prompt, giving agents context about where things stand.

## How Agents Use Memory

- The supervisor has access to `write_memory`, `update_long_term_memory`, and `update_state` tools
- Memory and state are loaded into the system prompt at startup
- Agents reference past memory when planning and making decisions
- `/compact` preserves key context even when older messages are summarized
