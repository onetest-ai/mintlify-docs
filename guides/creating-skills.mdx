Skills are reusable prompt modules that extend Octo's capabilities. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter.

## Interactive Wizard

The fastest way to create a skill:

```
/create-skill
```

The wizard guides you through:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name and description">
    Validated format with collision detection against existing skills. Description doubles as the trigger — describe WHEN to use the skill.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Purpose">
    Detailed description of what the skill does, its workflow, and expected input/output.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settings">
    Model invocation (can the LLM trigger it?), permissions (filesystem, network, shell), and tags.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI generation">
    An LLM generates the full skill body based on your description, using existing skills as examples. The SKILL.md is previewed before saving.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Skills are immediately available after the graph rebuilds.

## Manual Creation

## SKILL.md Format

```markdown
---
name: summarize-pdf
description: Summarize PDF documents into concise bullet points
dependencies:
  python:
    - pymupdf
  system:
    - poppler
---

When asked to summarize a PDF:

1. Use the `Read` tool to read the PDF file
2. Extract the key sections and main arguments
3. Produce a bullet-point summary with:
   - Main thesis / purpose
   - Key findings (3-5 points)
   - Conclusions and recommendations
4. Keep the summary under 500 words unless asked for more detail
```

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | Skill identifier (lowercase, hyphens ok) |
| `description` | Yes | One-line description shown in `/skills list` |
| `dependencies` | No | Dependencies to auto-install |

## Dependency Types

```yaml
dependencies:
  python:
    - pymupdf>=1.23.0
    - pandas
  npm:
    - "@playwright/mcp"
  mcp:
    - name: playwright
      type: stdio
      command: npx
      args: ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
  system:
    - poppler       # shown for manual install
    - ffmpeg
```

| Type | Auto-installed? | How |
|---|---|---|
| `python` | Yes | `pip install` into active venv |
| `npm` | Yes | `npm install --prefix .octo/` |
| `mcp` | Yes | Added to `.mcp.json` |
| `system` | No | Displayed for manual installation |

## Installation Location

Skills are installed to `.octo/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

## Invoking Skills

Once installed, invoke a skill as a slash command:

```
/<skill-name>
```

The skill's prompt is injected into the conversation, guiding the agent's behavior for that interaction.

## Publishing Skills

Skills can be shared via Git repositories. The marketplace commands (`/skills search`, `octo skills search`) discover published skills.

<Tip>
Keep skills focused on a single task. A skill that does one thing well is more reusable than one that tries to do everything.
