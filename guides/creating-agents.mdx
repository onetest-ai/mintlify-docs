Agents are defined by `AGENT.md` files — a Markdown document with YAML frontmatter that tells Octo what the agent does and what tools it needs.

## Interactive Wizard

The fastest way to create an agent:

```
/create-agent
```

The wizard guides you through:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name and description">
    Validated format with collision detection against existing agents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent type">
    **Standard** (tools + prompt) or **Deep research** (persistent workspace with planning middleware).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tool selection">
    Numbered table of all available tools (built-in + MCP). Shortcuts: `builtin`, `all`, `none`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Purpose description">
    Free-text description of what the agent should do.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI generation">
    An LLM generates a full system prompt based on your description, selected tools, and examples from existing agents. The AGENT.md is previewed before saving.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Agents are immediately available after the graph rebuilds.

## Manual Creation

Create `.octo/agents/<name>/AGENT.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-analyst
description: Analyzes data files and produces reports
type: ""
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - Bash
---

You are a data analyst. When given a dataset or file path:

1. Read and understand the data structure
2. Identify patterns, anomalies, and key metrics
3. Produce a clear summary with findings

Always show your work — include the commands you ran and their output.
```

## Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | Agent identifier (lowercase, hyphens ok) |
| `description` | Yes | One-line description shown in `/agents` and used by supervisor for routing |
| `type` | No | `""` for standard, `"deep_research"` for deep agents |
| `tools` | No | List of built-in tool names. Omit to get all built-in tools |

## Deep Research Agents

Set `type: deep_research` for agents that need:

- **Persistent workspace** — files at `.octo/workspace/<date>/`
- **Planning middleware** — TodoList for tracking multi-step work
- **Summarization middleware** — automatic context compression
- **Sub-agent spawning** — delegate subtasks

Deep agents are built with the `deepagents` library and get their own middleware stack automatically.

## Agent Loading

At startup, Octo loads agents from:

1. **AGENT_DIRS** — external project directories (colon-separated in `.env`)
2. **`.octo/agents/`** — Octo-native agents

List all loaded agents with `/agents`.

## Tips

<Tip>
Write clear, specific descriptions — the supervisor uses them to decide which agent handles each request. Vague descriptions lead to poor routing.
</Tip>

<Note>
The system prompt (everything below the frontmatter) supports full Markdown. Use headers, lists, and code blocks to structure your agent's instructions.
