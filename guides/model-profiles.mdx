Model profiles are presets that map model tiers to agent roles, letting you balance cost and quality with a single setting.

## Built-in Profiles

| Profile | Supervisor | Workers | High-tier Agents | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `quality` | high | default | high | Complex tasks, important work |
| `balanced` | default | low | high | Daily use, good tradeoff |
| `budget` | low | low | default | Cost-sensitive, simple tasks |

## Configuration

Set the default profile in `.env`:

```env
MODEL_PROFILE=balanced
```

## Runtime Switching

Switch profiles during a conversation:

```
/profile              # show current profile
/profile quality      # switch to quality
/profile budget       # switch to budget
```

The change takes effect on the next agent invocation.

## How Tiers Map to Models

Each tier resolves to a model from your `.env`:

```env
HIGH_TIER_MODEL=claude-opus-4-5-20250929
DEFAULT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
LOW_TIER_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

So with the `balanced` profile:
- **Supervisor** uses Sonnet (default tier)
- **Workers** use Haiku (low tier) — fast and cheap
- **High-tier agents** (deep research) use Opus (high tier) — maximum quality

## Switching Models

Change the active model directly:

```
/model claude-opus-4-5-20250929
```

This overrides the profile for the current session.
