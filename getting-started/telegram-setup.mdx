Octo includes a full bidirectional Telegram bot that shares the same conversation thread as the CLI. Chat with your agents from your phone.

## Create a Telegram Bot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Talk to BotFather">
    Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Send:

    ```
    /newbot
    ```

    Follow the prompts to name your bot.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the token">
    BotFather will give you a token like:

    ```
    123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your Telegram user ID">
    Talk to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get your numeric user ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure .env">
    ```env
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
    TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID=your_numeric_id
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Octo">
    ```bash
    octo
    ```

    The Telegram bot starts automatically alongside the CLI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Features

The Telegram transport supports:

- **Text messages** — full conversation with agents
- **Voice messages** — transcribed via Whisper, replied to with TTS (requires ElevenLabs)
- **File attachments** — agents send research reports and files as Telegram documents
- **Proactive messages** — heartbeat and cron results delivered to your phone
- **Rich formatting** — Markdown-to-HTML conversion for code blocks, bold, lists

## User Authorization

By default, only the owner (configured via `TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID`) can use the bot. Manage access with:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/authorize <user_id>` | Grant access to a user |
| `/revoke <user_id>` | Remove access |

Authorized users are stored in `.octo/authorized_users.json`.

## Shared State

The Telegram bot shares the same conversation thread and graph lock as the CLI. This means:

- Messages from CLI and Telegram appear in the same conversation
- Agents have full context regardless of which transport you use
- The `asyncio.Lock` prevents race conditions between transports

<Warning>
If you're using both CLI and Telegram simultaneously, messages are serialized through the graph lock. One transport waits while the other's request is being processed.
</Warning>

## Voice

Enable voice responses with ElevenLabs:

```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=...   # optional, uses default voice
```

Toggle in chat with `/voice on` or `/voice off`.
