Octo includes a full bidirectional Telegram bot that shares the same conversation thread as the CLI. Chat with your agents from your phone.

## Create a Telegram Bot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Talk to BotFather">
    Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). Send:

    ```
    /newbot
    ```

    Follow the prompts to name your bot.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the token">
    BotFather will give you a token like:

    ```
    123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your Telegram user ID">
    Talk to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get your numeric user ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure .env">
    ```env
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
    TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID=your_numeric_id
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Octo">
    ```bash
    octo
    ```

    The Telegram bot starts automatically alongside the CLI.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Features

The Telegram transport supports:

- **Text messages** — full conversation with agents
- **Voice messages** — transcribed via Whisper, replied to with TTS (requires ElevenLabs)
- **File attachments** — agents send research reports and files as Telegram documents
- **Proactive messages** — heartbeat and cron results delivered to your phone
- **Rich formatting** — Markdown-to-HTML conversion for code blocks, bold, lists
- **Remote management** — full slash command support for managing Octo from your phone

## Telegram Commands

Octo registers its commands with Telegram on startup via `set_my_commands()`, so they appear in the autocomplete menu when you tap `/`.

### Session Management

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Show all available Telegram commands |
| `/clear` | Reset conversation (new thread) |
| `/compact` | Summarize older messages to free context |
| `/context` | Show context window usage |

### Info

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/agents` | List loaded agents |
| `/model` | Show current model |

### Skills

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/skills` | List installed skills |
| `/skills search <query>` | Search the skill registry |
| `/skills install <name>` | Install a skill + rebuild graph |
| `/skills remove <name>` | Remove a skill + rebuild graph |

### MCP Servers

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/mcp` | Show MCP server status |
| `/mcp find <query>` | Search the MCP registry |
| `/mcp remove <name>` | Remove a server + rebuild graph |
| `/mcp disable <name>` | Disable a server + rebuild graph |
| `/mcp enable <name>` | Enable a server + rebuild graph |
| `/mcp reload` | Reload all MCP servers |

<Note>
`/mcp install` requires an interactive wizard and is not available via Telegram. Use the CLI or ask the AI to help configure it.
</Note>

### System

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/reload` | Hot-reload: re-reads `.env`, reloads config, rebuilds graph |
| `/restart` | Cold-restart: replaces the process via `os.execv` (same thread) |

<Tip>
If Octo gets into a bad state (context overflow, stuck agent, broken tool calls), send `/restart` from Telegram to cold-restart without going to your Mac. The conversation resumes in the same thread.
</Tip>

### Pass-Through

Any unrecognized `/command` passes through to the AI supervisor as regular text. This means `/<agent_name> do something` works from Telegram too.

## User Authorization

By default, only the owner (configured via `TELEGRAM_OWNER_ID`) can use the bot. Manage access with:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/authorize <user_id>` | Grant access to a user |
| `/authorize` | List authorized users |
| `/revoke <user_id>` | Remove access |

You can also reply to someone's message and send `/authorize` to grant them access.

Authorized users are stored in `.octo/authorized_users.json`.

## Shared State

The Telegram bot shares the same conversation thread and graph lock as the CLI. This means:

- Messages from CLI and Telegram appear in the same conversation
- Agents have full context regardless of which transport you use
- The `asyncio.Lock` prevents race conditions between transports

<Warning>
If you're using both CLI and Telegram simultaneously, messages are serialized through the graph lock. One transport waits while the other's request is being processed.
</Warning>

## Voice

Enable voice responses with ElevenLabs:

```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=...   # optional, uses default voice
```

Toggle in chat with `/voice on` or `/voice off`.
