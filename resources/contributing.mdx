We welcome contributions! See the full [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/onetest-ai/Octo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub for detailed guidelines.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onetest-ai/Octo.git
cd Octo
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[cli]"
octo init
```

## Key Guidelines

- **Verify syntax** after editing any Python file: `.venv/bin/python -m py_compile octo/<file>.py`
- **Follow existing patterns** — the codebase is consistent
- **Lazy-import** heavy dependencies inside factory functions
- **One change per PR** — keep PRs small and focused

## Common Changes

Since v0.5.0, the package is split into two layers: `octo/core/` (embeddable engine) and `octo/` root (CLI-specific code). Root-level files like `graph.py` and `middleware.py` are backward-compat re-export shims.

| Change Type | Files to Update |
|---|---|
| New LLM provider | config.py, models.py, wizard/onboarding.py, wizard/validators.py, wizard/doctor.py, README.md |
| New slash command | cli.py, ui.py |
| New built-in tool | core/tools/, core/graph.py |
| New middleware | core/middleware.py |
| New storage backend | core/storage/ |

## Reporting Issues

- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/onetest-ai/Octo/issues) first
